# 💰 Debt Management App

A clean, simple, and powerful web app built to help individuals and small businesses **track and manage debts owed by customers** — because everyone deserves financial clarity and peace of mind.

This app is your digital ledger for recording debts, tracking individual items, and knowing exactly who owes what — and how much. Built with care using **React** and **Vite**, this tool is optimized for simplicity, speed, and future scalability.
